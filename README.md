Plotting faceoffs in R.

These files will allow you to plot faceoff data in R. I've done my best to make it as easy to follow as possible. 

Here's how to use these files. 

1. If you are not a patron of Evolving Wild, you won't have the option 2 available to you, so you'll have to use this. 

Put RinkFunction.R into a directory. 

In Manny's Scraper file, change the season and gameID at the bottom. You should only need to put one game in here, 
regardless of how many games you are going to be looking at. 

Run Manny's Scraper. 

In FaceoffPlotScrape, follow the directions in the comments at the top. 

2. If you are an EW patron, then you can just use RinkFunction.R and the EW code here. 

Put RinkFunction.R into a directory

Open FaceoffsUsingEWData.R and follow the directions.

Any questions, you can find me on twitter @pflynnhockey. You can also email me at peteflynn@gmail.com.
